              A full-stack developer passionate about software development and
              web technologies. This is my personal blog site where I share my
              learnings, hefty tricks and pitfalls as I encounter them during my
              software development journey.

              I like to think of this as my journal where I share what excites
              me and frustrates me while developing applications. I also love
              trying out new frameworks and bleeding edge technologies and it
              would be fun to share my experience with the community.
